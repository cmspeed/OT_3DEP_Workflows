    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The United States Geological Survey's 3-D Elevation Program (3DEP) is collecting high-quality light detection and ranging (lidar) data over the conterminous U.S., Hawaii, and the U.S territories. Data acquisition is ongoing, with over 1800 3DEP datasets consisting of more than 42 trillion points covering an area of greater than 6.5 million $km^{2}$ already available for use. Data are hosted and publically available in Entwine Point Tile (EPT) format in an<a href=\"https://registry.opendata.aws/usgs-lidar/\"> Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 public bucket</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "3DEP point cloud data can be accessed through several user interfaces including the <a href=\"https://portal.opentopography.org/datasets\">OpenTopography Data Portal</a> and the <a href=\"https://prd-tnm.s3.amazonaws.com/LidarExplorer/index.html#/process\">USGS Lidar Explorer</a>. In many cases, however, users may prefer to access and produce derivative products from the 3DEP lidar data programmatically, particularly in the case of more advanced users seeking to access and process immense swaths of lidar point cloud data on local, commercial cloud, or high performance compute infrastructure. However, to date tools and/or workflows for programmatic access and processing of the 3DEP data remain underdeveloped.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook is part of a suite developed by OpenTopography in collaboration with the USGS National Geospatial Program, in an effort to leverage available APIs and cloud resources to enhance access and usability of 3DEP data and products for the geospatial community. Importantly, these notebooks are designed to be accessible by user's with limited experience in the Python programming language and as educational tools for those looking to learn about accessing, processing, and visualizing cloud-hosted data with Python. These notebooks use open-source Python libraries, including the Point Data Abstraction Libary (PDAL) and Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) for all point cloud and raster processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "This and the other use-case specific Jupyter Notebooks developed as part of this effort for programmatic 3DEP access are available in a <a href=\"https://github.com/cmspeed/OT_3DEP_Workflows\"> Github repository </a> and may be run locally or on the <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/\">Google Colaboratory</a> cloud platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specific features of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Users may (1) select an area of interest (AOI) directly in an interactive map within this notebook or (2) import a shapefile defining their area of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. API request to <a href=\"https://registry.opendata.aws/usgs-lidar/\"> Amazon Web Services (AWS) EPT (Entwine Point Tile) S3 bucket</a> returns 3DEP point cloud data within user-defined AOI for subsequent processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flexible and customizable PDAL pipelines are available for specifying point cloud resolution, filtering, reclassifying, and reprojecting points.\n",
    " \n",
    "4. API request to NAIP Imagery Service for imagery within the user-defined AOI.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. 3DEP lidar points are assigned RGB values from NAIP imagery\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Colorized point cloud data are saved to local directory or on Google Drive (if user uses Google Colaboratory option, see below.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Funding\n",
    "\n",
    "Funding for the creation and distribution of these Jupyter Notebook-based workflows was provided as by the <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/centers/community-for-data-integration-cdi\">USGS Community for Data Integration (CDI)</a> through the funded grant <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/centers/community-for-data-integration-cdi/science/enhancing-usability-3dep-data-and-web-services\"> *Enhancing usability of 3DEP data and web services with Jupyter notebooks*</a>.

    "Importantly, after the map is rendered, the user must define the desired 'point cloud resolution' using the radio buttons below the map. An estimation of the total number of lidar points within the bounding box is provided based on the area of the AOI and the total number of lidar points in the 3DEP dataset(s). Selecting the \"Full\" option will return all points in the quad (this number can be quite large, depending on the size of the AOI). Selecting any of the other options for resolution will return the appropriate number of points to ensure at least one lidar point per Nth meter (where N is the chosen resolution). The Entwine Point Tile (EPT) file format utilizes an octree structure for the point cloud, and the chosen resolution defines how deep in the octree to request points to obtain the specified resolution. This depth, and total number points varies drastically based on a number of parameters including local topography and vegetation. Therefore, the 'resolution' paramater and the total point count do not scale linearly. In other words, specifying a resolution of 2m will likely return far less than half of the number of points returned with 'full' resolution. The estimate of the full poin total provided is not exact, but should give the user some idea of how many points to expect the resultant point cloud to contain. \n",

The NAIP program supports these goals by acquiring and providing ortho imagery that has been collected during the agricultural growing season in the U.S. The NAIP ortho imagery is tailored to meet FSA requirements and is a fundamental tool used to support FSA farm and conservation programs. Ortho imagery provides an effective, intuitive means of communication about farm program administration between FSA and stakeholders. New technology and innovation is identified by fostering and maintaining a relationship with vendors and government partners, and by keeping pace with the broader geospatial community. As a result of these efforts the NAIP program provides three main products: DOQQ tiles, Compressed County Mosaics (CCM), and Seamline shape files The Contract specifications for NAIP imagery have changed over time reflecting agency requirements and improving technologies. These changes include image resolution, horizontal accuracy, coverage area, and number of bands. In general, flying seasons are established by FSA and are targeted for peak crop growing conditions. The NAIP acquisition cycle is based on a minimum 3 year refresh of base ortho imagery. The tiling format of the NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 pixel buffer on all four sides. NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook is designed to make accessing, processing, visualizing, and creating derivative products with 3DEP more straightforward. Specifically, this notebook provides a workflow for programmatically accessing the 3DEP lidar point cloud data using an API request to the cloud-hosted AWS S3 bucket, performing basic processing steps on the point cloud data, and colorizing the lidar points by the corresponding NAIP imagery RGB values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feedback regarding the workflow, specific use cases, and any computational testing with the notebook are welcomed and encouraged!"
